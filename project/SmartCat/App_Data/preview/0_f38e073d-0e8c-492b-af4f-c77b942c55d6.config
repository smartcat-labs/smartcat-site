<p>Time. Time changes the world around us, constantly. Irreversibly. With each change, we have two options: adapt or live in the past. Embracing the change is what evolution is all about. It is a necessary survival skill. The faster you adapt, the greater is your advantage against competition.</p>
<p>In the past, businesses were run based on what you know and who you know. That is still true today, however the ways we gain our knowledge and create our contacts have become lightning fast thanks to advances in technology.</p>
<p>In this brave new world, the difference between professionals and amateurs boils down to the decision making process - experienced decision makers rely on their previous experiences and their "gut feeling", while today's professionals rely on facts. Real-time facts. In ever-faster changing world, our perspectives need to change with it in order to reach smarter insights that lead to smarter decisions. Careful and planned analysis of available data provides these insights and empowers the decision makers with agility necessary for the survival in the markets of tomorrow.</p>
<p>But we can even take you a step beyond… Outsmart the time. Take control. Bring on the changes and shape the future in your favor.</p>
<p>Connect the dots. Get the big picture. <br /> Don't be in the dark. Be in the know. Take control. The smart way.</p>]]></rteContent>

        <serviceContent><![CDATA[<p>This is the most comprehensive service of all. We must truly understand your business before we make any decisions. It all starts with an intake phase, where a workshop is held to help us understand your business and strategy. This knowledge then becomes the guiding light for all future decisions and suggestions. A solution design phase is where we get creative and use prototyping for the proof of concept, before the implementation starts.</p>
<p>We are far past the architecture where you had to choose a language and database and start your three layer monolithic application development. We live in a polyglot world where applications look like building blocks where you need to integrate a couple of technologies together to achieve the project goal. We believe in polyglot approach in order to choose the right technology for a specific use, pick appropriate data sources, define how data will be stored, analysed and integrated. If backend system needs to be cross platform done in language with great community support and frontend needs to be interactive, we will go with a combination of java/scala and angularJS, if some data comes from sensors, but we have a true relational account model we will go with a combination of cassandra and relational database of choice. Microservice architecture helps us a lot with this approach since it enables us to wrap different functionalities behind service and define API so we can easily maintain and change if needed. We are proud to say that we have production experience with distributed microservice architecture and we are well aware of potential problems so we are not forcing that architecture because it is hype, we are simply suggesting it where we recognise a need and could benefit from it.</p>]]></serviceContent>

        <serviceContent><![CDATA[<p>We are way past the time when you had to choose a data storage provider and put all data in it without worrying about use cases of specific data models. We are strong believers in polyglot persistence, within this level of service we will analyse your use cases and suggest the most appropriate data storage for the specific aspects of your application. We consider data modeling very important because doing it right will make the latter phases of analysis and prediction much easier. Data Storage for huge amounts of data brings along problems with volume, velocity and variety of the incoming data. In order to store information efficiently for fast writes and fast reads and scale right, storage must be fault tolerant and distributed with easy maintenance and deployment. Epic wars between the relational and non-relational world are behind the community, NoSQL vendors are mature enough and production proven. We have experience with the majority of vendors, both in NoSQL and relational world, and we make a choice based on use case.</p>
<p>Indexing engines are an addition to storage when you need to provide a wide variety of data queries. Distributed databases are built for speed and performance but their tradeoff is inability to support complicated relational queries with joins, group by etc. Indexing engines bring this functionality to the system. Indexed data is held in memory and complicated queries are served fast. We have experience with elasticsearch and solr.</p>]]></serviceContent>

        <serviceContent><![CDATA[<p>It is hard to think of an enterprise application these days without the need for integration, both internally among many small services and externally with public APIs or 3rd party services. With the emergence of IoT and public APIs this has become a common requirement. For successful integration, data needs to be processed and this needs to be done fast, fault tolerant, usually in async and non blocking matter (?).  You need to fill your application with a lot of data for release, attach to public API, convert data to your data model and you are ready to go. This goes for the other end of integration, exposing data to outside world, since this data can rarely be exposed without preprocessing first. We have experience with a huge variety of public APIs, protocols and tools for data processing (messaging systems, stream computing systems, batch processing tools and reactive technologies).</p>
<p>In order to leverage truly distributed systems you need to have a <strong>messaging system</strong> that enables implementing many microservices which communicate with each other through asynchronous non blocking messages (we have experience with kafka, rabbitmq, zeromq and mosquitto). Storing data alone is not enough, data usually needs to be processed before writing and reading. For this problem, we use <strong>stream computing systems</strong> which are able to process large amounts of data in parallel before the data is stored (we have experience with apache spark and apache storm). <strong>Batch processing</strong> is always needed when you work with big data, since some data sets are so large they cannot be processed in real-time. Data must be migrated from different data sources and this needs to be done in parallel and in background (we have experience with apache spark and spring batch for batch processing needs). In order to build a highly concurrent and distributed message-driven system with high throughput and low latency, we are using <strong>reactive technology</strong> (we have experience with akka).</p>]]></serviceContent>

        <serviceTitleImage>1077</serviceTitleImage>
        <serviceContent><![CDATA[<p>Probably the most valuable service since it can directly influence the business with new insights.  This is where our team of business analysts and business intelligence experts turns data into insights by utilizing graphical representation and analysis techniques to identify the patterns that help you understand your customers, your business or your employees better.</p>
<p>First, we need to fully understand the business. In a perfect scenario, this understanding would come through architecture service and building of the system. If we do not participate in that phase we will have to go through workshops and documentation to create business requirements for this phase.  This is where our data science team comes to play. They analyze the business and the data and come up with algorithms that can produce meaningful results business wise. In the last step, data science and engineering teams team up to implement those new algorithms in the application, resulting in a better and smarter application. Our business experts are there to facilitate the process, help with implementation and verify if goals are met at the end.</p>
<p>A couple of things can be achieved in this service, data will be closer to business decision makers in a form that has a meaning, application will be closer to customers and their needs, time for reaction will be lower because everything will be well displayed and transparent, new business ideas can arise from analytics and trending.</p>
<h3>Big Data Use cases</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Analytics systems</strong> which gather application usage information to make better end-user experience (example is an analytics system for a shopping cart which saves user searches each time and slowly learns how to show products which the user shows most interest in)</li>
<li><strong>Internet of things</strong> platform which collects device data, stores them and visualizes data in the form of reports, pie charts, trends and predictions</li>
<li><strong>Logging platform</strong>, since applications are growing, microservices is a trend in IT industry and it is becoming challenging to follow all logs and reports</li>
<li><strong>Gaming industry</strong> (similar to case 1) where game usage can be stored and analysed in order to adjust game play </li>
<li><strong>Data warehouse modernization</strong> which is about building on top of existing data warehouse infrastructure, leveraging big data technologies to improve system efficiency (pre processing, offloading, exploration)</li>
<li><strong>Fraud and intrusion detection</strong> systems that recognize fraud patterns and protect data</li>
<li><strong>Supply chain planning and process optimisation</strong> in various industries providing business intelligence and requirements prediction</li>
