                            Time. Time changes the world around us, constantly. Irreversibly. With each change, we have two options: adapt or live in the past. Embracing the change is what evolution is all about. It is a necessary survival skill. The faster you adapt, the greater is your advantage against competition.

                            In the past, businesses were run based on what you know and who you know. That is still true today, however the ways we gain our knowledge and create our contacts have become lightning fast thanks to advances in technology.

                            In this brave new world, the difference between professionals and amateurs boils down to the decision making process - experienced decision makers rely on their previous experiences and their "gut feeling", while today's professionals rely on facts. Real-time facts. In ever-faster changing world, our perspectives need to change with it in order to reach smarter insights that lead to smarter decisions. Careful and planned analysis of available data provides these insights and empowers the decision makers with agility necessary for the survival in the markets of tomorrow.

It all starts with an intake phase, where a workshop is held to help us understand your business and strategy. This knowledge then becomes the guiding light for all future decisions and suggestions. A solution design phase is where we get creative and use prototyping for the proof of concept, before the implementation starts.</a>

With the emerging of IoT and public APIs this has become a common requirement. For successful integration, data needs to be processed and this needs to be done fast, fault tolerant, usually in async and non blocking manner. We have experience with a huge variety of public APIs, protocols and tools for data processing (messaging systems, stream computing systems, batch processing tools and reactive technologies).</a>
