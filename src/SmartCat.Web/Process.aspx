                            Clear, transparent and proactive communication is our obsession. So you can always be in the know. It is your right as our customer.

                            Our solution design process, software development methodology and project management standards are based on globally acclaimed standards such as SMART data process, agile development methodologies and PMI standards. These standards guarantee a top-notch level of our service.

                            We aim to impress our clients with our professionalism, operational maturity and customer service. The only way to bring value is to solve problems, to create solutions. The only way to understand them is to understand the environment, history and the big picture. We strongly believe that doing anything without full understanding is a clear sign of lack of dedication; a lack of care that can never bring out the full potential of a fruitful cooperation.

                                    In order to gain new insights and find the answers, one must know which questions to ask. In this phase, our team of Consultants, Business Analysts and Data Scientists works with you to identify a list of strategically important questions that will help you understand your customer needs better, gain new insight into operational efficiency, gauge employee engagement and satisfaction or help understand efficiency of a marketing initiative. Once we know the questions, we plan out getting the answers. We identify the data sources, types of data we want to analyze and how we intend to tie it all together.

                                    Based on the output of last phase, we get to work to make it come to life. Our Big Data Technologies Experts and other Software Engineers work to implement the software solutions that will store, process and analyze the gathered information. Your involvement in this phase is also essential as our process demands early feedback to ensure we’re doing exactly what you had in mind. As our customer you will participate in the Solution Design Phase (Prototyping → Proof of Concept → Review & Optimize) after which we will implement, launch and fine-tune the solution in production environment.

                                    Once the system is in place for capturing the data, it’s time to distill it into precious information that will allow for new insights to emerge. Our multidisciplinary team of Consultants, Business Analysts, Graphic Designers and Front-end Software Engineers will create insightful representations of collected data in a graphical and eye-opening ways. Ways that answer those strategic questions identified in the Setup phase.
